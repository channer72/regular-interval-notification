    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <p>This tool sends out an audio ping at regular intervals of your choice. It is designed to serve as a repeating reminder or timer for a task.</p>
    <p>I initially created this tool to help stay on track while studying, as I would find myself occasionally drifting away from my notes and assignments.</p>
